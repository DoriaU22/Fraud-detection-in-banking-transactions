## ðŸ¤– Models Trained and Results

| Model               | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Naive Bayes        | 0.91     |
| Decision Tree      | 0.82     |
| Random Forest      | 0.91     |
| K-Nearest Neighbors| 0.90     |
| Logistic Regression| 0.91     |
| Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) | 0.91 |

> Note: In this case, emphasis was placed on accuracy. However, due to class imbalance, it is recommended to focus not only on accuracy, but also on recall and F1 score for model evaluation.
